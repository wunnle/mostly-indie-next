These *Undertale* remixes... fill me with determination.

This is a cover album that has 24 songs from the game *[Undertale](https://undertale.com/)* on its two sides: red (metal boss fight covers) by [RichaadEB](https://www.patreon.com/RichaadEB) and blue (electronic) by [Ace Waters](https://amiewaters.bandcamp.com/). The first half has most of my favorite tracks from the original soundtrack and the battle music is amazing with metal tunes. But I’m also obsessed with the chiptune on the other side, it’s still so different from the originals. The whole album is just perfect!
