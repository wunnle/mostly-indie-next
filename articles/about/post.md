Hi there, I'm Kübra, a game studies scholar based in Freiburg, Germany. \
 \
On this blog, I share my (non-academic) opinions (mainly) on games I've recently played and enjoyed. I always like to discover new indie gems, especially puzzle games, and talk more about my current favorites, 
so feel free to get in touch with me--currently on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/mostlyindie.com).
